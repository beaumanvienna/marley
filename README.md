## User Manual

Marley is a bundle of console emulators for x86_64 Linux systems.
The project is comprised of Mednafen, Dolphin, 
Mupen64plus, PPSSPP, and PCSX2.
Marley's launcher interface is designed to be used with 
gamepads. Gamepads can be hotplugged and automatically detected
in the launcher interface. Marley also allows to configure 
the button assignment of a controller manually. The controller settings 
are shared with all emulators. Marley allows browsing
ROM collections and launching games for the GBA, GBC, NES/SNES, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, N64, PS1, PS2, PSP, Gamecube, and Wii. <br /> 
<br />
Please make sure to install an
OpenGl driver for your graphics card. <br /> 
<br />
If you have a Bluethooth gamepad, 
you need to pair it with your computer first before it can be used in Marley. 
The Wiimote is an exception and needs to be directly paired with Marley. On newer 
Wiimotes, you need to press 1 and 2 at the same time. For older Wiimote models, 
you need to press a small button in the battery compartment. <br />
<br />
There is a setup screen to configure Marley. The folder path to the ROM collections needs to be entered with a keyboard, as well as a path to the firmware of the PS1, PS2, and Sega Saturn. All other settings are configured automatically.<br />
<br />
To contact us, open a ticket on the issue tab. Pull requests are welcome! <br />
<br />
A big thanks to the teams of Mednafen, Dolphin and PPSSPP, Mupen64Plus, and PCSX2. Thanks for all the work you put into your projects and the awesome emulators you provide. All credits go to you guys, while this project here is just a small front end.<br />
<br />
Happy retro gaming! <br />
<br />

<br />
## Controls
<br />
Use your controller or arrow keys/enter/escape on your keyboard to navigate.<br />
<br />
Use "f" to toggle fullscreen in-game or in the front end.<br />
<br />
Use "F5" to save and "F7" to load game states while playing.<br />
<br />
Use the guide button to exit a game with no questions asked. The guide button is the big one in the middle.<br />
<br />
Use "ESC" to exit. Same as guide button.<br />
<br />
Use "p" to print the current gamepad mapping(s) while in the front end.<br />
<br />
Use "l" to print a list of detected controllers to the command line while in the front end.<br />
<br />
Use B on the controller or arrow key down + LEFT_ALT on your keyboard to get from OFF to SHUTDOWN. You can shut down the computer from there.<br />
<br />
command line options: <br />
<br />
  --version             : print version <br />
  --fullscreen, -f      : start in fullscreen mode<br />
  --killX11pointer, -k  : switch off the mouse pointer for the entire desktop<br />
  --update-resources, -u: update fonts, pictures, etc.<br />
<br />

## System requirements
<strong />OS:</strong>
 <br />
Marley runs on 64-bit Linux platforms such as Linux Mint, Ubuntu or Arch Linux, with Nvidia, Intel, or AMD OpenGL graphics acceleration.  Either X11- or Wayland-based desktops are supported, though sound skipping has been observed with HDMI configured as sound output on Arch Linux and Manjaro.
 <p />
<strong />CPU/GPU:</strong>
 <br />
Marley's system requirements vary by core, and while it is difficult to ascertain specific hardware configurations, general guidelines may be considered.  For example, PlayStation 1 and Nintendo 64 emulator cores may run at full speed on 2010-era systems; while PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Wii systems may require more advanced processing power from 2015-era systems to achieve full speed.  For GPU performance, a 3D PassMark rating of about 1800 is sufficient for any and all of its cores.
 <p />
As a point of reference, Marley runs all emulator cores flawlessly on a Udoo Bolt V8 single-board computer (SBC), which is based on an AMD Ryzen Embedded V1605B Quad-Core processor and an AMD Radeon Vega 8 GPU. This SBC has roughly twice the performance of a MacBook 2013 with a CPU PassMark rating of 7900.
 <p />
<strong />Input:</strong>
 <br />
USB and Bluetooth gamepads are supported.  Bluetooth is required for some input devices such as the Nintendo Wiimote and Wii MotionPlus.
<br />

## Developer information
Marley is using five core modules that are linked as static libraries. This way, it is ensured that the core modules are always available, compiled with the same compiler / compiler version, and against the same dependencies. Resources are shared among the front end and the emulators. For the most part, these are the SDL game controller instances, the SDL main window, and the Open GL settings. <br />
<br />
Pull requests are welcome! The project needs Open GL and game programmers to bring more life into the front end. It should feel like a retro game or console eventually. A retro art designer would also be great.  Other programming tasks include integrating more core modules such as Scumm VM or RPCS3, porting the ROM collection browser from Kodi to C++/Marley, or simply testing and bug fixing.<br />
<br />
Marley knows only big-á¹•icture mode. This is to resemble a gaming console. It is designed to be a "sofa" application or could be used for a DIY arcade machine. Marley does not have mouse support or allow pop-up windows. All core modules render into an SDL Open GL context in the main window. While Mednafen, PPSSPP, and Mupen64Plus were doing this already and were easy to integrate, Dolphin was changed from an X11 Open GL context and PCSX2 was changed from a wxWidgets context. <br />
<br />
Difficulties arise when changing the previously standalone emulators into libraries that can get called multiple times. For all five core modules, the initialization was reworked to remove any dependencies from globally initialized signals. <br />
<br />
The mapping of the game controllers happens entirely in the front end. Unlike the old SDL_Joystick, the SDL_Gamecontroller has a fixed mapping. Marley is taking advantage of this. The default settings in the core modules are hard-coded to the SDL_Gamecontroller. This way, the very first run of a core module automatically generates the correct ini files. Marley is using the SDL game controller database and a nifty little trick to find similar controllers in the database when there is no exact match. Marley supports standard PS/X-Box controllers, as well as less-than 15-button controllers such as the NES gamepads. It also supports the Nintendo Wiimote by using Dolphin's built-in drivers in the front end.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Marley has a configuration folder in which the core modules save their settings. Marley is completely isolated from other emulator installations. <br />
<br />
The project build system is autoconf, however, most emulator modules use cmake. The build processes are chained together. Marley can be compiled with gcc or clang. We tried integrating Travis into the Github repository. Unfortunately, the build was too long (or their build server too slow) and it got canceled.  Github CI has yet to be looked into. There are no intentions to set this project up for Windows. Since most people prefer gaming under Windows, pull requests in this regard are welcome, though. The emulators should work fine under Windows, except for PCSX2, for which the latest x64 version supporting both Linux and Windows did not work. This PCSX2 version is trying to allocate memory close to the program code, which unfortunately fails when the other core modules are present. This issue could be solved with a few defines. <br />
<br />
Currently, development takes place under Ubuntu and Arch Linux. Testing is happening under Bionic and Focal, Linux Mint, Arch Linux, Manjaro and Gentoo, and soon also under Fedora. <br />
<br />
There is a unit test for each core emulator available to help isolate faults, improve debugging, and decrease compile time during development. Adding a core module begins with creating a new unit test. When the unit test is up and running, the core module can be added to the main application. To build the unit tests, run ./configure in the project root folder and say 'make unit_tests' in tests/.<br />
<br />
To debug marley, run "configure --enable-debug" and "make" in the root directory. Start gdb and run "./marley". Create the unit tests as described above. To debug PCSX2, set 'handle SIGSEGV nostop noprint' and 'handle SIG32 nostop noprint' in gdb or run the unit test version "./tests/pcsx2/PCSX2" without any additional arguments in the terminal (not gdb). The normally-dormant GUI of PCSX2 should come up. React with "no" to any assert messages. Select the interpreter instead of the recompiler for the Emotion Engine under Emulation Settings / EE and IOP and close PCSX2. Launch gdb in tests/pcsx2 and run "./PCSX2 myGame.iso". To debug dolphin, set "Fastmem" to "False" in ~/.marley/dolphin-emu/Config/Dolphin.ini. Start gdb in tests/dolphin and and run "./DOLPHIN myGame.iso". A good front end for gdb is gdbgui, see https://www.gdbgui.com/.<br />

### clone and check out branch <br />
git clone https://github.com/beaumanvienna/marley  <br />
cd marley <br />
#change to the branch you like to work with (currently only 'master')  <br />
git checkout master <br />

### Define the number of CPU cores to be used for compiling
#"-j1" for one core, "-j2" for two cores, etc. <br />
#To use all available CPU cores, say:<br />
export MAKEFLAGS=-j$(nproc)

#Check, if MAKEFLAGS is as expected:<br />
echo $MAKEFLAGS

### Configure and make
aclocal && autoconf && automake --add-missing --foreign<br /> 
./configure --prefix=/usr<br />
make<br />


### Start it
./marley <br />

### Install system-wide
sudo make install <br />

### Remark: using clang instead of gcc<br />
#From where "Configure and make" is described above, say<br />
export CXX=clang++<br />
export CC=clang<br />
aclocal && autoconf && automake --add-missing --foreign && ./configure CXX=$CXX CC=$CC<br />
make<br />
<br />
##  Having trouble compiling?<br />
<br />
Sometimes similar packages can cause compile issues. This means too many packages are installed.<br />
A good solution for this problem is to compile in a clean chroot.<br />
<br />
Under Arch Linux, there is a script called 'extra-x86_64-build' to build a PKGBUILD file in a clean chroot, <br />
see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_clean_chroot:<br />
<br />
Under Debian-based installations, follow the below process:<br />
(And see also https://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/chroots.html):<br />
<br />
# install Debian bootstrap tool<br />
sudo apt-get install debootstrap <br />
<br />
# create change root environment for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)<br />
sudo debootstrap focal focal/<br />
<br />
#chroot into the system<br />
sudo chroot focal/<br />
<br />
#install 'add-apt-repository'<br />
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common<br />
<br />
#add repository 'universe' <br />
sudo add-apt-repository universe<br />
sudo apt update<br />
<br />
#get dependencies for focal (returns an error, which can be ignored)<br />
