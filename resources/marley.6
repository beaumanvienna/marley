.SH NAME
marley \- Many Awesome Retro Linux Emulators, Yay! 
.SH SYNOPSIS 
marley [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Marley is a suite of console emulators plus a launcher app. 
In version 0.2.17, the bundle is comprised of Mednafen, Dolphin, 
Mupen64plus, PPSSPP, and PCSX2.
Marley's launcher interface is designed to be used with 
gamepads. Gamepads can be hotplugged and automatically detetcted
in the launcher interface. Marley also allows to configure 
the button assignment of a controller maunally. The controller settings 
are shared with all emulators. Marley allows to browse 
one's ROM collection and launch games for the GBA, GBC, NES, SNES, N64, 
PS1, PS2, PSP, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, Gamecube, and Wii.  Please 
make sure to install an OpenGl driver for your graphics card. If you 
have a Bluethooth gamepad, you need to pair it with your computer first 
before it can be used in Marley. The Wiimote is an exception and 
needs to be directly paired with Marley. On newer Wiimotes, you need 
to press 1 and 2 at the same time. For older Wiimote models, 
you need to press a small button in the battery compartment.
